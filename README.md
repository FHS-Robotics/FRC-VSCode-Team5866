<h2 align="left">Project Naming Conventions</h2>

A note about naming conventions for competition code.  The best convention is one that sorts itself numerically and alphabetically.  Notice that projects ending with the year do not get sorted by year.  For future projects, instead of naming in this format **"PROJECTNAME-YEAR"**, use **"YEAR-PROJECTNAME"**.
\
\
For example, "2025-UnderwaterGame" would be the best way to name the 2025 code.  Note "2022HogRider" and "2022RapidReact" as the best examples.  This concept can be applied to file naming conventions of builds, projects, and in your personal file structures.  One way that I write the names of repetitive files or folders is by starting with the year, then month, then day.  For example, "24-0213 Notes.docx" would be a way to establish where a notes Word document should fall within a folder of other notes.
In my own business ventures, I name projects that I am doing for others with a unique year-code that establishes what year I began the project for someone and the sequence that I started those projects.
\
\
Here is how I name project folders inside of my "Projects" directory:
- 23001 JP Cosplay
- 23002 Velasco Motion Platform
- 23003 Tristane Cosplay
- 23004 Pumpkin Animatronic
- 23005 Nitinol Research
- 23006 Yellowscan Rig
- 23007 HCAS Lab
- 23008 Horizontal Reach Study
- ...

You can see how this pattern can continue.  You can easily understand what the project is based on its name, and it is also indexed.  I would recommend using this practice when coding for the 5866 team and for organizing your files as well.  For every school year, I name it "2024 Spring" and "2024 Fall" which sorts every semester folder very easily.
